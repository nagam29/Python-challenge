# Python-challenge
Please review PyBank. This is my completed home work.

I also worked on PyPoll but has not been completed. I worked on the following items:
The total number of votes cast
A complete list of candidates who received votes
The percentage of votes each candidate won
The total number of votes each candidate won
The winner of the election based on popular vote.
